## Courses with R at Cal Poly

- Stat 331: Statistical Computing with R
    
<br>

- Upper-level Stat Courses: Most profs use R

<br>

- Introductory "service" courses for non-majors
    + No CS or Stat background or prereqs
    + No Disagreement: Software should be used
    + Debatable: R should be used
    + Unpopular: Students should write code

# Advantages of Coding in Intro Classes


## Pedagogical:

<div align=center;max-width:300px;float:left>
![](/Users/kbodwin/Dropbox/Talks-and-Presentations/Images/tidy.png)
NOT
</div>
<div align=center;max-width:300px;float:right>
![](/Users/kbodwin/Dropbox/Talks-and-Presentations/Images/ttest_steps.jpg)
</div>

## Conceptual:

"Imagine that you calculate a sample mean for a population..."

VERSUS

```{r}
head(iris$Sepal.Length)
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
```



## Real-world relevance:

<div align=center;max-width:700px;float:center>

</div>


# Challenges


## Pedagogical:

How to involve coding in teaching... <br> ...without teaching coding

<div align=center>
```
"Why are we learning this if it's not on the test?"

  - Several students
```
</div>


## Logistical: Installation and File Management

 <div align=center>
"Where is my downloads folder?"
  - Generation Z, ages 17-23
  </div>
  <br>
<div align=center;style="max-width:500px">

</div>

## Motivational:  Stats are scary!  Code is scary!

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
path = "C:/Users/kbodwin/Dropbox/Student_Surveys"

pre1 <- read_tsv(paste0(path, "/Pre_Lab_Questionnaire_1.txt"))
pre2 <- read_tsv(paste0(path, "/Pre_Lab_Questionnaire_2.txt"))
pre3 <- read_tsv(paste0(path, "/Pre_Lab_Questionnaire_3.txt"))

pres <- rbind(
  pre1 %>% rename(Answer = `Q03_nervous`) %>% select(Answer) %>% mutate(Lab = 1),
  pre2 %>% rename(Answer = `Q09_nervous`) %>% select(Answer) %>% mutate(Lab = 2),
  pre3 %>% rename(Answer = `Q05_nervous`) %>% select(Answer) %>% mutate(Lab = 3)
)

pres %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Lab, fill = Answer)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ggtitle("Q: I feel nervous about my ability to complete the Lab Assignment.") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div")
```

(Stat 218, Fall 2018)

## A few great resources

Great helper resources:

- Cloud servers:
    + RStudio Cloud + RStudio Connect
    + Amazon Web Services
    + University hosted servers

- Notebooks  (Markdown, Jupyter)
- GitHub Classroom
- `usethis` and other helper packages


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
path = "C:/Users/kbodwin/Dropbox/Student_Surveys"

pre1 <- read_tsv(paste0(path, "/Pre_Lab_Questionnaire_1.txt"))
pre2 <- read_tsv(paste0(path, "/Pre_Lab_Questionnaire_2.txt"))
pre3 <- read_tsv(paste0(path, "/Pre_Lab_Questionnaire_3.txt"))

pres <- rbind(
  pre1 %>% rename(Answer = `Q03_nervous`) %>% select(Answer) %>% mutate(Lab = 1),
  pre2 %>% rename(Answer = `Q09_nervous`) %>% select(Answer) %>% mutate(Lab = 2),
  pre3 %>% rename(Answer = `Q05_nervous`) %>% select(Answer) %>% mutate(Lab = 3)
)

pres %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Lab, fill = Answer)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ggtitle("Q: I feel nervous about my ability to complete the Lab Assignment.") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div", direction = -1)
```


# Lab Assignments

## Example: Wine data

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Load the data
wine = read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/i83wfy7qhb3wf8s/redWines.csv?dl=1")
```

```{r}
str(wine)
```


## V1: I supply the code

Do a hypothesis test at the 0.05 level, to see if the bad wines and good wines have the same pH level or not.   What do you conclude?

```{r}
t.test(pH ~ quality, data = wine, alternative = "two.sided")
```


## V2: Reproduce my process

Do a hypothesis test at the 0.05 level, to see if the bad wines and good wines have the same pH level or not.   What do you conclude?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
t.test(pH ~ quality, data = wine, alternative = "two.sided")

```

Do a t-test comparing `density` across good and bad wines at the 0.05 level. 

```{r}
### YOUR CODE HERE
```


## V3: Students as statisticians

Choose three chemical attributes of wine that you are interested in.  
<br>
For each of your chosen chemical properties, perform an appropriate hypothesis test to compare good and bad wines.  
<br>
Discuss each of the tests - what do you conclude about these chemical properties?

# Shiny Pre-Lab Exercises

<div align=center>
```
"Tools for learning statistics vs. Tools for doing statistics:

We need a bridge between the two"

  - Amelia McNamara, ICOTS 2018
```
</div>


## Principles

A tool to ease the transition for beginners should...

1. Produce real and interesting data results without advance training, like an applet.

2. Require students to generate queries, not simply select from options, like true coding.

3. Make clear what is a built-in function and what input they get to choose.

4. Link concepts and questions from class to digital input/output.

# Student Outcomes

## Students recognize applicability

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mid1 <- read_tsv(paste0(path,"/Mid_Lab_Questionnaire_1.txt"))
mid2 <- read_tsv(paste0(path,"/Mid_Lab_Questionnaire_2.txt"))
mid3 <- read_tsv(paste0(path,"/Mid_Lab_Questionnaire_3.txt"))

# Help in real world
mid_rw <- rbind(
  mid1 %>% rename(Answer = `Q02_real world`) %>% select("Answer") %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(Lab = 1),
  mid2 %>% rename(Answer = `Q08_real world`) %>% select("Answer")%>% na.omit() %>% mutate(Lab = 2),
  mid3 %>% rename(Answer = `Q04_real world`) %>% select("Answer")%>% na.omit() %>% mutate(Lab = 3)
)

ggplot(mid_rw, aes(x = Lab, fill = Answer)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + ggtitle("Q: The in-class lab activity helped me understand how statistical analyses \n are conducted in the real world.")  +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div", direction = -1)             
 
```

(Stat 218, Fall 2018)

## Students recognize value

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mid_concepts <- rbind(
  mid1 %>% rename(Answer = `Q03_concept help`) %>% select("Answer") %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(Lab = 1),
  mid2 %>% rename(Answer = `Q09_ex_concepts`) %>% select("Answer")%>% na.omit() %>% mutate(Lab = 2),
  mid3 %>% rename(Answer = `Q05_concepts`) %>% select("Answer")%>% na.omit() %>% mutate(Lab = 3)
)

ggplot(mid_concepts, aes(x = Lab, fill = Answer)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + ggtitle("Q: The in-class lab activity helped me understand the concepts \n from this week's material.")  +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div", direction = -1)    
```

## Students are proud of their work

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
post2 <- read_tsv(paste0(path,"/Post_Lab_Questionnaire_2.txt"))

post2 <- post2 %>% select(`Q00_pride`) %>% mutate(
  Pride = factor(`Q00_pride`),
  Pride = factor(Pride, levels = c(levels(Pride), "5 : Strongly Disagree"))
)

post2 %>% na.omit() %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Pride, fill = Pride)) + geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Q: I feel proud of the work I produced on the Lab Assignment.") +
  xlab("Response") + scale_x_discrete(drop=FALSE)  + scale_colour_hue(drop = FALSE)  +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div", direction = -1)
```

(Stat 218, Fall 2018)

## Students gained skills

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
concepts <- read.csv(paste0(path,"/concepts1.csv"))

concepts %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(
  Phase = factor(Phase, c("Before", "Midpoint", "After"))
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Phase, fill = `identify.param.stat`)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  ggtitle("Q: I feel confident in my ability to read and interpret a barplot.") + 
  labs(fill = "Answer") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div", direction = -1)
```

## Exercises helped the transition to labs

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
halfs <- read_csv(paste0(path,"/halfs.csv"))

halfs %>% select(-Lecture) %>% gather(key = Type, value = Answer, -Quarter) %>% mutate(
  Quarter = factor(Quarter, levels = c("Winter 2018", "Fall 2018"))
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, fill = Answer)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + facet_wrap(~Type) + ggtitle("Q: The [homework/lab] assignments helped me understand and practice the material.") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div", direction = -1)

```

# Take-Home Messages

## What worked

- Students left class with the ability to actually analyze data from scratch.

<br>

- Anecdotally: deeper understanding of *some* concepts.

<br>

- Student satisfaction with tangible results.


## What needs work


- Encouraging thinking through code versus guess-and-check with copy-paste.

<br>

- Motivating the need for coding to the *students*

(Disconnect between class time allocation and tested material.)

<br>

- Logistics of creating/hosting exercises:  \{demoR\} and \{shindig\}!


## Advice

- Growing pains and logistical headache are worth it.


<br>

- Introductory, non-major students *can* handle R!

</div>


## My unpopular opinion

<font color="DodgerBlue" face="courier" type="bold">
<font size=10>

Computing isn't a supplement to the material; it *is* the material.

If we aren't teaching them to think computationally, 
we aren't actually teaching them statistics.
</font>
</font>

## Final pitch:

<div align=center>
```
"Not all statisticians should be coders, 
but all statisticians should code."

  - Hadley Wickham, ICOTS 2018
```
</div>

Coming soon: 

- \{demoR\}      (JSM 2019)

- \{shindig\}    (Fall 2019?)
